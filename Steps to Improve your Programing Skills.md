## Steps to Improve your Programming skills

Programming is one of the on-demand skill in today's world. Due to the development of technology more and more programmers are needed in the companies. First and foremost you should have programming knowledge and you should know at least one programming language like C, C++, Java or Python, etc. When learning programming language you first learn the syntax which may vary from one programming language to another but the core concepts remain the same. So here are the 5 tips that will make you a super powerful programmer.
1) ### Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
When you are given a problem statement you have to find the solutions. As soon as you see a problem think of the algorithm and then convert it to a code that provides the solution for the problem. There are Data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs that have their own existing algorithms. Some of the problems can be solved by understanding the existing algorithms and modifying them according to our needs.

2) ### Read Others Code
We will write a program for the given question according to the logic we think. This code may or may not be an efficient solution based on time and space complexity. So read other people's code that will give you a new way to solve the problem in a more efficient way. You may find other people's code in GitHub and discussion forums on several websites.

3) ### Competitive Programming
The best way to improve your logical and programming skills is to participate in competitions like debugging and programming events. You will get to know about your level when you compete with others. Nowadays we can practice this online on websites like CodeChef, HackerEarth, Codeforces, etc. They don't accept your code sometimes as it is not up to the mark so you have to try to give more efficient solutions. This teaches you to keep trying without losing hope. In most of these websites, a link to the article may be given that will teach you to solve the problem.

4) ### Explore Other Programming Languages
Don't stick to one programming language because each and every language has its own advantages and benefits. Have your favorite programming language but don't stick to it. For example, when you learn functional programming with Scala try to implement those features in your favorite language like Java. That will help you to master any language.

5) ### Build Projects
The ultimate goal of any programmer is to build projects. So start building projects with the language you are comfortable with from the beginning. This is the most important step so don't forget to follow all these steps and get placed in a good product company
